# Install Python, then Microsoft Powershell,
# then Microsoft VS Code


# For the Mac and Linux:
# Try python3
# Also
# This might be useful to locate Python:
# find / -name python


# Create python environment:
python -m venv venv

# The "python" above MUST be the correct version of Python;
# the one you've just installed

# Activate the virtual environment for Powershell:
./venv/bin/Activate.ps1
